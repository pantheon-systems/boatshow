As deck boats have become bigger and broader and pontoon boats have become more powerful, performance-ready and posher, the two categories have drawn closer.<br/><br/>Sporty and stylish, deck boats come in a variety of configurations, from sunpad-topped sterndrive power to outboard engines directed by single-side console. Taking to the water from one of them, you can enjoy being in the water or bouncing along on top of it as generous powerplants provide plenty of oomph for waterskiing, wakeboarding and tubing.","Deck boats have wide deck to carry 8 to 12 or more passengers (like pontoons) but look and perform more like runabouts. They are powerful, too, making them excellent boats for skiing, tubing and wakeboarding.",,1000,deck-boat,deck-boats,1,1,"Take a bowrider, stretch out the seating area in front of the windshield, or the “bow cockpit,” and you’ve got the template for the average deck boat, a craft that typically retains the fiberglass hull and nimble agility of a bowrider while increasing passenger space. Deck boats maintain their width, “or beam”, farther forward, rounding out or squaring off the bow’s normally V-shaped to add more versatile seating forward. ","Like the bowriders they evolved from, deck boats offer tremendous versatility. Cruise, cove, tow your favorite water toy or fish, all are easily doable on this jack-of-all-trades platform. Enhancing the fun is a deck boat’s additional passenger space, stability, and possible amenities including a space for a toilet, “ or head compartment”, or even sink/food prep area. Look for a wraparound windshield if you desire protection from the elements; open styles, similar to the average pontoon boat, are also popular for those that don’t mind a little wind in their hair. Look for extended swim platforms to enhance your time socializing at anchor or enjoying the sandbar. Watersports or fishing packages also tailor the boat to an owner’s individual needs.  ","Sterndrive power is the go-to engine for many deck boat manufacturers. Sterndrives tuck the engine below a lounge area (sunpad) or the engine box at the back of the boat, and allow for an easily accessible and uninterrupted swim platform.
<p></p>
Outboard power has seen a resurgence in recent years. Quiet and easy to service, outboards create additional cockpit room and storage space by positioning the engine behind the back of the boat off the transom. Outboards can also be fully lifted or “trimmed”, out of the water.

Jet power is another popular alternative. Jets have no exposed propeller, relying instead on an enclosed impeller and jet nozzle to deliver the engine’s thrust. Jets typically can venture into shallower waters, boast rapid acceleration, and feature nimble handling.

34,3,1,en-US,Cuddy Cabins,Cuddy Cabin,cuddycabin,"Take a bowrider, put a closed deck over it with some living space within, and you’ve got a cuddy cabin. It’s a versatile, family-style boat that’s nimble and maneuverable and offers a V-berth, head, sink, and maybe a galley. Count on plenty of storage space to keep everyone's stuff secure but handy and on plenty of general 'people' space for relaxed boating. Choose your power: outboard, stern-drive or jet.<br/><br/>The cuddy cabin differs from its cousin, the runabout, in that the latter’s closed deck isn’t designed as much for creature comforts as it is for storage and maintaining a sleek, sport-car look.<br/><br/>Your cuddy cabin boat may feature a sunpad, swim platform, or towline hook for skiing, tubing and wakeboarding. You can focus on play, not maintenance, thanks to the self-bailing liner in many cockpits.

Cuddies essentially swap out the open front seating area of a traditional bowrider for a small, enclosed cabin. Typically featuring a V-berth (a V-shaped bed designed to fit within the contours of the bow), and possibly a head (marine toilet or porta-potti), freshwater sink, and minimal galley (kitchen), the cabin complements a traditional main seating area, or “cockpit”, layout.  ","Like boats of similar size, a cuddy cabin works well for cruising, entertaining, watersports, or just hanging out with friends at the sandbar. The cuddy cabin, however, opens up new possibilities as nighttime falls. Rather than head back to the dock, anchor out and spend the night under the stars with the waves gently rocking you to sleep. Or, turn the marina into your weekend getaway, spending the night dockside with other marina guests. Feeling claustrophobic? Consider adding a camper enclosure for the main cockpit. A cuddy can also be practical and used to securely store an abundance of gear. ","Sterndrive power is the go-to engine for most cuddy cabins.

37,3,1,en-US,Ski/Wake/Surf Boats,Ski/Wake/Surf boats,inboardski,"The term “inboard” means the boat’s engine is seated within the hull of the boat and the propeller extends out the bottom, typically between the stern and midships. Some inboards are purpose-built for a specific water-sports discipline, while others are designed with versatile water-sports performance in mind. Direct-drive inboards, for example, are designed specifically to tow three-event water skiing (slalom, trick and jump). Water skiers prefer the smallest possible wake because it allows them to pass over it quickly and easily while in route to the next buoy or the jump ramp. As a result, a direct-drive’s engine resides in the center of the boat, which helps minimize displacement at water-skiing speeds, leading to the flattest possible wakes. A center-mounted pylon is also crucial to water-skiing performance, making it a fixture on direct-drive boats. <br /><br /> Inboards that are designed for wakeboarding and wakesurfing almost exclusively employ a V-drive configuration. This places the engine in the stern, which frees up more seating space inside the boat and adds weight to the back of the boat for the larger wakes coveted by wakeboarders and wakesurfers. V-drives are also generally bigger than direct-drives in terms of length, beam, dry weight, and passenger and ballast capacity, because wakeboarders and wakesurfers need more displacement to generate bigger wakes in order to perform tricks. In the sport of wakesurfing, it’s absolutely essential to have adequate displacement because the surfer needs to be able to let go of the handle and be propelled solely by the power of the wave generated by the boat. Wakeboarders also generally prefer some sort of elevated tow point like a tower so they can stay up in the air longer and land bigger tricks. <br /> <br />Some inboards are designed to marry the best parts of wakeboard, wakesurf and water-ski boats to create a water-sports compromise. Often referred to as hybrids or crossovers, these inboards are a great fit for boaters whose family and friends like to do a little of everything, from water-skiing to wakeboarding to wakesurfing. Characteristics of hybrids include a tower, ballast, wake-shaping plate and removable center-mounted pylon. The running surface of a crossover can be unique in that it starts with a deeper V than most slalom boats and finishes flatter than most wakeboard boats to optimize the wake for each sport at its respective speed.","Carve the morning glass on skis, soar over the wakes on a wakeboard, or surf an endless wave…ski/wake/surf boats are your gateway to fun!",Ski/Wake/Surf Boats,1000,inboard-ski-and-wakeboard-boat,inboard-ski-wakeboard-boats,1,1,"For the serious ski or wake enthusiast, the performance — and wake — of a dedicated inboard towsports boat is hard to beat. The classic “ski” boat features a shallow hull angle at the back of the boat. This angle is referred to as the transom deadrise. Ski boats also usually position the engine in the center of the boat. This combined with the shallow deadrise allow the boat to run at a level attitude.  The result is strong acceleration and minimal wake size, allowing slalom skiers to quickly get up and on top of the water and effortlessly carve back and forth behind the boat with minimal interruption.
<p></p>
In contrast, its wake-oriented counterpart features a deeper-v shaped hull (boat bottom), and positions that engine at the back of the boat. The boat’s running attitude is further altered with extra weight, also called “ballast”, or specially crafted tabs or hydrofoils, pumping those wakes up as large as possible and shaping them to create the perfect launch ramp for wakeboarders to achieve their biggest air.  Propellers are tucked well under the bottom of the boat for safety and performance; steering is accomplished via a pivoting rudder.
<p></p>

This configuration also makes an inboard an ideal choice for the fast-growing sport of wakesurfing, as surfers are positioned in close proximity to the back of the boat. Traditional sterndrives or outboards should never be used for wakesurfing, as their props are far more exposed.

","Water skiing started the watersports craze, and it’s still the favorite pastime of many enthusiasts. Start kids or beginners out on combo (twin) skis; more advanced skiers can drop a ski to go “slalom,” carving across the water on an agile single ski. Those that prefer to take things skyward will enjoy wakeboarding and the seemingly endless array of aerial maneuvers that are possible. Wakeboarders use a sideways stance to ride a single, wide board similar to a skateboarder or snowboarder, and the wake as a ramp to launch themselves into the air. Wakesurfing is also growing fast in popularity, with riders literally able to surf the wake behind the boat. With its low speeds, wakesurfing is low-impact and accessible to a wide variety of ages and skill levels. Look for ballast tanks, tabs or hydrofoils to alter wake size and shape. Center-mounted tow pylons (attachment points for the riders rope) provide a solid pivot point for skiers. Wakeboarders prefer elevated towsports towers, which anchor the towrope higher off the water for better height on jumps. ","Sterndrive or jet-powered boats remain a solid choice for recreational skiing and wakeboarding. The boat's running attitude can be altered with similar hardware to an inboard, including ballast and tabs. While traditional sterndrives are not safe for wakesurfing, a new innovation — the forward-facing sterndrive — does make it possible for sterndrive manufacturers to safely supply a wakesurfing-capable engine. Forward-facing sterndrives locate the propeller on the front, rather than the rear of the drive unit, to position the prop safely out of reach. Jets, with no exposed propeller, are also a viable choice for recreational wake surfing. <p></p>The traditional inboard, sometimes called a direct drive, positions the engine in the center of the hull to help maintain a level running attitude. The driveshaft passes through the hull and connects the engine to a fixed propeller. Steering is accomplished via a movable rudder, located farther back from the propeller blades.
<p></p>
V-Drive is a variation on the inboard theme. The engine is positioned toward the back of the boat, or the “stern”, freeing up space in the main seating area, or “cockpit” and adding weight to naturally boost the boat’s wakes. The driveshaft runs forward to a v-shaped linkage, where it reverses direction and exits the hull to the fixed propeller. A steerable rudder, farther back from propeller, controls the boat’s direction.
<p></p>
Sterndrives tuck the engine below an upholstered lounge, or “sunpad, or the engine box, and allow for a clean, uninterrupted swim platform off the back of the boat, or “stern”. While people can wakeboard and ski behind a traditional sterndrive, wakesurfing requires a forward-facing sterndrive for safety.
<p></p>
A variation on the sterndrive, forward-facing sterndrive engines position the propeller at the front of the drive unit, rather than the back. This positioning tucks the propeller safely out of reach underneath the bottom of the boat, or “hull”, and makes these engines a viable and safe choice for wake surfing.

Jets have no exposed propeller, relying instead on an enclosed impeller and jet nozzle to deliver the engine’s thrust. Jets typically can venture into shallower waters, boast rapid acceleration, and feature nimble handling.

Two such deep-V hulls, connected by a deck that usually includes a cockpit or cabin, comprise a catamaran, the most popular multi-hull powerboat.<br/><br/>Three hulls make a trimaran, which are more common in sailboats than powerboats. A small step removed from a multi-hull is a powerboat with a cathedral hull — three narrow hulls directly connected, often with a common rear planing pad.<br/><br/>Although the catamaran has long been considered a two-outboard-engine configuration, some manufacturers are bringing single-outboard cats to market.<br/><br/>Not only are multi-hulls efficient — read: fast and fuel-thrifty — they’re spacious and offer soft rides, great cornering and out-of-corner acceleration. Anglers like catamarans for their high-speed performance and fishing stability, but they also make great sport boats, performance boats and even cruisers.<br/><br/>Fans say catamarans handle a bit differently, but insist that learning to drive one is easier than mastering a conventional mono-hull boat.","Featuring two or three hulls, rather than the more common single hull, multi-hull powerboats include designs for hardcore freshwater and saltwater fishing, as well as recreational and cruising, complete with expected amenities.",,1000,multi-hull-power-boat,multi-hull-power-boats,1,1,"When it comes to efficiency, a long, narrow boat bottom, or “hull” is ideal, but the design is not the most realistic choice for hauling passengers and gear. Multi-hull powerboats take the long, narrow hull concept and double or triple it, enjoying these efficient, deep-V designs in the water while connecting them with a roomy main seating area, or “cockpit”, or even cabin above. Most multi-hull powerboats follow the catamaran (two hull) design; trimarans (three hulls) are often used in sailboats. The widely spaced hulls offer excellent stability, comfort and handling in rough waters. ","Multi-hull designs can be found in a variety of boats, from fishing boats to cruisers and even high-performance models. As such, the activities you can enjoy with these boats are many — fishing, cruising, racing, poker runs, all are within reach. Larger multi-hulls offer surprising cabin space within the deep hull cavities. A multi-hull boat’s excellent stability also makes for a confident platform for passengers. ","Due to the multi-hull configuration, outboard power is the most common choice. Quiet and easy to service, outboards create additional space in the main seating area, or “cockpit”, and storage space by positioning the engine behind the boat’s back panel, or “transom”. Outboards can also be fully lifted, or “trimmed”, out of the water.
 <p></p>


Inboard engines position the engine within the boat’s bottom, or “hull”, and only immerse a portion of the driveshaft (the rod connecting the engine to the propeller) and propeller in the water below the hull, often advantageous in saltwater environments. Steering is accomplished via a movable rudder, located aft of the propeller blades.

60,3,1,en-US,Jet Boats,Jet Boat,jet,"A jet boat’s propulsion system, almost completely enclosed within the hull, draws water from beneath the boat into a pump spun by the engine and expels it through a nozzle. That provides thrust that propels, and when directed from side to side, steers the boat.<br/><br/>That’s the technical stuff. What a jet boat does, though, is leap onto plane and dart across a lake, changing direction in a heartbeat while captain, passengers and maybe a tuber all grin. In short, jet boats make boating a blast.<br/><br/>Jet boats expel water above the waterline — nothing protrudes below the hull — so the boats can run on plane in less water. Oh and how they run! While the smallest jet boats — personal watercraft — are in their own category, many of today’s jet boats look and perform like bowriders, with their generous seating, swim platforms and the thrilling maneuverability of jet power.","Like bowriders and deckboats, they offer comfortable seating and sunning areas, plus a speedy and exciting ride. They are distinguished from runabouts by their propulsion system, which is enclosed inside the hull.",,1000,jet-boat,jet-boats,1,1,"Jet boats rapidly earned a reputation as thrilling, high-performance rides but in recent years the platform has matured to the point that the boat’s jet power is now considered just another viable alternative to a sterndrive, outboard or even inboard. Yes, the high-performance reputation is still deserved; jets leap onto plane with little hesitation, boast thrilling speeds and handle with unparalleled agility. Jet power, however, is also more compact (opening up interior space), contained within the hull (eliminating worries about an exposed propeller and allowing the boats to run in shallower waters), and easy to maintain.","Most jet boats fall within the bowrider/deckboat mold, meaning you can do all of the popular activities, from hauling your kids on that wakeboard or tube to cruising the shore on a pleasant evening or heading to a waterfront restaurant. Fish? Of course, and there are even several center-console designs specifically made for the serious enthusiast. Wakeboard and wakesurf models are also available, adding ballast (extra weight for wake sports) and tow towers to enhance the ride. Current offerings can all be easily trailered to and from the water. ","There’s only one, and the name says it all — jet propulsion. Jet drive eschews propellers in favor of an impeller housed within an enclosed jet pump.  Water is drawn into the pump through an intake under the hull (the boat’s bottom). That water is then pushed out through the pump’s venturi, a funnel-shaped cone that reduces the outlet diameter. The concept is much like placing a finger over the end of a garden hose. The velocity of the water is increased, and it’s that force that pushes the boat through the water.
<p></p>
Jet drives are touted for their safety advantages. There’s no exposed propeller, and the lack of hardware below the hull allows jet-drive boats to run in shallower water than their prop-driven counterparts. Jets also typically boast impressive acceleration and, thanks to a directional nozzle that redirects the thrust, nimble handling. Personal watercraft are most recognized for jet propulsion, but jets, with their compact footprint and impressive acceleration, have also proven to be a powerful force in the 17’-25’ sport boat market.

63,3,1,en-US,Inflatables,Inflatable,inflatable,"Two categories of inflatable boats, roll-up inflatables or rigid-hull inflatable boats (RIBs), share key benefits that distinguish them from other types of boats. These boats are suitable for saltwater and freshwater fishing, watersports and more.","Inflatable boats range in size from 8-foot dinghies for tenders to 30-foot high performance boats. These boats are suitable for saltwater and freshwater fishing, watersports and more.",,1000,inflatable-boat,inflatables,1,1,"As their name suggests, inflatable boats take their shape thanks to air, pumped into flexible tubes that form the front (bow) and sides. Durable rubberized, synthetic fabrics like Hypalon, PVC, or polyurethane are used to prevent punctures. A rigid transom (back if the boat) is commonly included to handle a small outboard motor. The floor can be inflated or rigid, the latter formed by assembling wood, plastic or aluminum panels.
<p></p>
A variation on the inflatable is the RIB, or rigid inflatable boat. RIBs feature similar tubes to form the bow and sides, but add a rigid hull (bottom running surface) and floor. This hull allows the boat to handle waves better, and provides a more comfortable ride. RIBs can also typically handle higher horsepower engines. ","Smaller inflatables are often used as tenders for larger boats, emergency rescue craft, as they are relatively quick to inflate/deflate and easily towed or stowed. Larger inflatables or RIBS are often chosen for their increased buoyancy, seagoing reputation, and built-in “bump” protection from docks or other vessels, traits that make them a popular choice with safety and law-enforcement agencies.","Outboard power is the most popular choice for inflatables and RIBs. Quiet and easy to service, outboards create additional room in the main seating area, or “cockpit”, and storage space by positioning the engine behind the back of the boat, also called the “transom”. Outboards can also be fully lifted, or “trimmed”, out of the water, an advantage when using a trolling motor to get into shallow waters.

The smallest inflatables are often powered by the passenger via oars.

776,3,1,en-US,Sailboats,Sailboat,cruisingsail,"A sailboat is actually a powerboat of sorts. First, because on most sailboats a small outboard or inboard engine moves them when the wind won’t. And second, because the boat is always powered, whether by wind or engine.<br/><br/>That said, there’s an almost limitless variety of watercraft on which sails are raised, from the windsurfer with its simple board and windowed sail to the tall ship with its elaborate rigging.<br/><br/>Many sailors cut their teeth on a small cartop or trailerable boat with a sail or two and a deployable centerboard or daggerboard. The next step is a boat with a fixed keel, which is more stable but more worrisome in shallow waters. Larger sailboats often have at least a small berth or sleeping area below deck. Some, built for long voyages, have luxurious furnishings.<br/><br/>Distinguish sailboats from one another by size, hull configuration, keel type, number and deployment of sails, and the boat’s purpose and use. Then match those features to your sailing tastes.","Sailboats differ from other types of boats in that they are propelled partly or entirely by wind; they use sails to transform the power of the wind into power that moves the boat through the water. The term sailboat covers a wide variety of sailing craft, each with its own characteristics and styles. In general, sailboats are distinguished by size, hull configuration, keel type, number of sails, use and purpose. To learn more about a specific type of sailboat, click on a category below.",,1000,sailboat,sailboats,1,1,"Sailboats run the gamut in size, from the simplest dinghy to the most prestigious “tall ship.” Their common theme is harnessing the power of the wind, rather than an engine, to propel them through the water. At least most of the time. While the smallest sailing vessels rely purely on the wind, most sailboats beyond the 18’ range rely on small inboard or outboard engines to move them through the water when the wind doesn’t cooperate or tight confines prevent the “tacking” back and forth that a sailboat uses to work with wind direction. Small sailboats use a centerboard (a board sticking out the bottom the boat to reduce sideways motion) and a rudder to maintain course and steer. Larger sailboats opt for a fixed keel, though its depth may prevent the boat from accessing shallower waters. Mono, or single-hull boats are most common, but catamarans (two hulls) and even trimarans (three hulls) are found in a variety of sizes.","Sailing is an activity in and of itself. Plotting a course with ever-changing wind speed and direction is both art and science, and handling, or “trimming the sails”, requires constant attention. A sailboat, however, particularly a larger one, is much like any other vessel. You can cruise, anchor out, or spend the night aboard. ","In addition to sheer wind power, small outboards are often utilized to provide motion. Outboards take up no room within the boat itself, are easily maintained, and can be tilted fully out of the water.
