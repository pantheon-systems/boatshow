# Config Import/Config Ignore/Config Split

## UnknownExtensionException during Drush Config Import [Sandstorm Jira: NMMA-213]

The error:
> Drupal\Core\Extension\Exception\UnknownExtensionException: The module gtm does not exist. in Drupal\Core\Extension\ExtensionList->getPathname() (line 520 of /mnt/www/html/discoverboatdev/docroot/core/lib/Drupal/Core/Extension/ExtensionList.php).

This seems to happen when we are removing a module from config_ignore during a new deployment. In this case we had already added gtm.settings to config_ignore, but then were attempting to push some changes up to dev which removed `gtm.settings` from the config_ignore list, and also deleted the gtm module.

My workaround was:

Manually remove the affected config entry from the deployment target admin page at /admin/config/development/configuration/ignore. If deploying to DEV2 for 16 sites, we would need to do this 16 times. I did it for miami and newyork

Run config import twice for each multisite e.g:

    vm$ drush @miami.dev2 cim -y
    vm$ drush @miami.dev2 cim -y
    vm$ drush @newyork.dev2 cim -y
    vm$ drush @newyork.dev2 cim -y

(itâ€™s possible that the first cim -y command should have been a cr, just to fix issues with the gtm module suddenly going missing)

The initial report on https://www.drupal.org/project/config_ignore/issues/2989021 recommends using drupal console to import the config_ignore config before running a full config import, I will try that approach to see if it works well.
