You anchor your boat when you are away from shore, tethering it to an anchor, a heavy, usually metal object lowered overboard to grab hold of the bottom.  Docking involves tying your boat to a fixed, usually wooden structure.","Anchoring, Docking &amp; Accessories",1,,,1,0
515,3,3,en-US,"Anchors, Chains, Cables, Rollers","Anchors, Chains, Cables, Rollers","","","An anchor is a heavy, usually metal object lowered from your boat to keep the boat from drifting.  Anchors are made in several different configurations; each type works in a different fashion and is used to grab on different types of bottom.  There is no single anchor design that is best in all conditions.  For most pleasure boats the fluke or danforth type, the plow, or the mushroom anchor will prove most effective.  .The danforth style is particularly popular because it will hold on soft or muddy bottoms as well as harder or rocky bottoms.  Mushroom anchors do not have the holding power of a fluke or plow anchor and should only be used on small, lighter weight boats. Be sure to choose the anchor style that will work most effectively in the area where you will be boating.

Anchors also must have something to attach them to the boat.  This is called the anchor rode.  Usually a length of heavy chain attaches to the anchor to help the anchor engage the bottom.  A long length of rope then attaches to the chain and leads back to the boat.  The whole length of rope and chain leading from the anchor back to the boat can be referred to as the anchor cable or ground tackle.  When you want to stop at a certain location, perhaps to fish or swim from your boat, lower the anchor until it grabs the bottom, lead the rope through a roller, usually positioned on the bow of the boat to guide the anchor, and secure the rope to a samson post, a cleat, or other solid fixture.

The amount of rode that you let out—the scope-- depends on water depth and weather conditions.  The deeper the water and more severe the weather ,the more rode.  At a minimum, let out enough rode to equal five to eight times  the depth of the water plus the distance from the water to where the anchor attaches to the boat.

528,2,3,en-US,"Boat Covers, Canvas","Boat Cover, Canva","","<p>To protect your boat when you&rsquo;re not using it or during road trips, you need a good boat cover.</p><h4>Cover Types</h4><p>Boat covers range from simple blue tarps to high-dollar, custom-fit affairs. For the sake of this discussion, we&rsquo;re going to simplify matters and review the two largest general categories of boat covers: Storage Covers and Trailerable Covers.</p><h5>Storage Covers</h5><p>A storage cover fits rather loosely. Its purpose is to shield your boat from the sun&rsquo;s ultraviolet rays (UV, for short), and to keep bird droppings, leaves and other airborne debris from contaminating your boat&rsquo;s interior.</p><p>You&rsquo;re likely to find storage covers on boats sitting in driveways, parked behind the house, or as the name implies, stored for any appreciable length of time. Some folks might even put the storage cover on while the boat&rsquo;s tied up at the dock to deter seagull-bombing raids. Kind of a hassle, but maybe preferable to washing bird poop off the seats.</p><p>Storage covers often have elastic or rope in the hem, as well as ropes and loops along the edges, to help keep the cover in place around the sides of the boat.</p><h5>Trailerable Covers</h5><p>A trailerable cover fits your boat like a glove, guarding your boat from UV damage, while preventing road grime from trashing your boat and its contents during transport to the launch ramp.</p><p>Unlike its storing cover cousin, a trailerable cover is made of stronger fabric, typically with reinforcements at potential wear points&mdash;places where the cover will contact sharp edges, like windshield corners, trolling motor mounts, and the like.</p><h4>Cover Characteristics</h4><p>Several qualities make up a good boat cover.</p><p>Boat covers must be:</p><ul><li>Water resistant, to keep the rain out.</li><li>Mildew resistant, so organic creepy-crawlies won&rsquo;t destroy the fabric.</li><li>UV resistant, to keep sun off of your boat, and to prevent the fabric from fading.</li><li>Breathable, to allow fresh air to flow, to keep the boat dry and prevent the cover&rsquo;s fabric from rotting away.</li><li>Strong enough to keep from ripping to shreds in a strong wind, or the first time you cinch a tie-down a bit too tight.</li></ul><p>In addition, we need to factor in how well the cover performs in climate extremes. For instance, a cover with a vinyl coating will keep the rain out in the summer, but once the temps drop below freezing, the coating won&rsquo;t retain its flexibility, cracking and splitting, thus rendering it useless.</p><h4>Textile Talk</h4><p>Based on what we&rsquo;ve been talking about, we&rsquo;re looking for some kind of &ldquo;wonder cloth&rdquo;, right&mdash;but it doesn&rsquo;t exist. Just like most other things, selecting the best boat cover material involves compromises between intended function, performance against the elements, and initial cost.</p><p>The four most common boat cover fabrics include pigment coated polyester, polyester/cotton blends, acrylic coated polyester, and urethane coated polyester. Each material does its job well&mdash;some of them better than others, as you can see in this chart:</p><table cellspacing=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" border=""0""><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Pigment Coated Polyester</th><th>60/40 Poly/Cotton</th><th>Acrylic Coated Polyester</th><th>Urethane Coated Polyester</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Water Resistant</td><td>BETTER</td><td>GOOD</td><td>BEST</td><td>BEST</td></tr><tr><td>Mildew Resistant</td><td>BETTER</td><td>GOOD</td><td>BEST</td><td>BEST</td></tr><tr><td>UV Resistant</td><td>BETTER</td><td>GOOD</td><td>BETTER</td><td>BEST</td></tr><tr><td>Breathability</td><td>GOOD</td><td>BEST</td><td>GOOD</td><td>GOOD</td></tr><tr><td>Strength</td><td>BETTER</td><td>GOOD</td><td>BEST</td><td>BEST</td></tr><tr><td>Hot Humid Climates</td><td>BETTER</td><td>UNADVISED</td><td>BETTER</td><td>BEST</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Fabric comparison chart (<a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.taylormadeproducts.com/catalog/"">www.taylormadeproducts.com/catalog</a>)</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We&rsquo;ve only scratched the surface of what goes into selecting a boat cover for your particular boat&mdash;but remember this: you&rsquo;ve got too much money tied up in your floating paradise not provide it with a loving blanket of protection.</p>","Many smaller or trailerable boats have removable cloth boat covers to envelop all or parts of the craft.  These covers are primarily for storage when not using your boat.  Boat covers may come standard with your boat, or you may need to buy them separately.

Quality covers are made of a heavy fabric, traditonally canvas, but more recently polyester cotton blends, dacron, and other durable, weather resistant fabrics, treated for resistance to mildew, stains, and UV rays.  Covers are usually water repellent and have sewn-in elastic cords along the hem line for a snug, tight fit.  Other features to look for include overlapping double-stitched seams, rotproof thread, quick-release buckles with nylon web straps, belt loops sewn into the top of the cover to keep upper straps in place, tie-down strap kits, and storage bags.

Cleanliness The first item on the agenda is washing your boat regularly. Yes, we know that swabbing the decks can be a hassle, but you&rsquo;ve got a lot of money tied up in your boat, so why not take care of it? A long-handled boat brush can make boat washing a great deal easier than scrubbing acres of hull sides by hand, as can one of those car-washing spray wands available from nearly any auto parts store. Use soaps and cleaners made especially for boats to avoid damaging your boat&rsquo;s finish. If you go boating in saltwater, make it a point to rinse your boat thoroughly with fresh water to remove any salt residue. It&rsquo;s a proven fact that a boat with a clean hull bottom is more fuel-efficient than a hull that&rsquo;s fouled with algae or other aquatic scum. Oil With the proliferation of those quickie oil change shops, most of us are pretty good about changing the oil in our cars and trucks. Just pull in, and 20 minutes later you&rsquo;re back on the road. Unfortunately, this concept hasn&rsquo;t caught on very well in the marine industry. You&rsquo;ve either got to change your boat&rsquo;s oil yourself or take it to your local boat dealer. Four-stroke outboards, inboards, and stern drive boats require regular oil changes. The duration between oil changes varies by manufacturer, but a good rule of thumb is to change the oil at least once a year or every 100 hours of operation (+/-). Changing the oil in your boat&rsquo;s engine is actually easier (in most cases) than changing the oil in your car. Similar process: start the engine, let it warm up for a few minutes, turn the engine off, drain the old oil, change the filter, put the drain plug back in, and fill the engine with new oil. Do not use automotive oil in your boat&mdash;this isn&rsquo;t the place to be cheap. Use only name-brand marine oil&mdash;your boat&rsquo;s engine works much harder than the engine in your car, and automotive oil doesn&rsquo;t have the chemical composition necessary for a marine engine. Propeller (Outboard &amp; Stern Drive) As part of your pre-launch routine, use a deep well socket and ratchet/breaker bar to ensure that the propeller nut hasn&rsquo;t loosened up and is tightened securely. Remove the propeller several times during the season to make sure that discarded fishing line hasn&rsquo;t become wrapped around the propeller shaft. This might seem trivial, but fishing line will cut into the propshaft seal in a surprising short time, allowing oil to leak out of the gearcase&mdash;and water to enter the gearcase. If you discover a wad of old fishing line on the propshaft, take your boat to your local marine dealer, and ask them to inspect the gearcase for you. (Other than changing the gear oil, gearcase service is not a do-it-yourself job). While you have the propeller off, visually inspect it for nicks, dents and other signs of underwater encounters. It&rsquo;s OK if your prop is missing some paint, but send it out for repairs if you find any evidence of impact. Now put a liberal amount of waterproof marine grease on the propeller shaft, and re-install the propeller (and related hardware) in the same order that you took it off. Don&rsquo;t forget to tighten the propeller nut to the manufacturer&rsquo;s specifications. Do It Yourself Obviously, space won&rsquo;t permit explaining every maintenance or repair procedure&mdash;there are plenty of instructional materials available that cover most do-it-yourself jobs in great detail. Don&rsquo;t be intimidated by working on your boat&mdash;take your time&mdash;you&rsquo;ll be surprised at how well you can figure things out on your own if you try.</p>","All boats, even the smallest fiberglass kayak or aluminum jon boat, require some regular care and maintenance.

An inflatable’s floor construction is the key to understanding the types of boats available and the tradeoff between the portability of the inflatables with flexible floors and the performance of rigid deep-V hulls made from composite plastic, fiberglass, or aluminum. Boats with more flexible floors fold to a light, compact shape, but If you want your boat to plane, allowing you to exceed 5 mph, a rigid floor is required.
•	Soft-stern dinghies, powered by oars or a small electric trolling motor, are the most basic inflatables at the lowest cost.
•	Rollup (RU) boats can be unrolled, inflated and launched in minutes, but are limited to in-harbor, relatively flat-water travel.
•	Sportboats are inflatables with a removable rigid floor system made from plywood, composite plastic or aluminum. 
•	High pressure (HP) inflatable floor boats combine the performance of a sportboat with the light weight and compact stowage of a soft stern dinghy.
•	Rigid inflatable boats (RIBs) or rigid hull inflatables  offer &quot;real boat&quot; performance and strength of a rigid moderate- or deep-vee hull

Systems come in single and double frequency models, but single frequencey is adequate for most lakes and shallow coastal fishing.

Fishfinders use a submerged transducer, mounted on the transom, inside the hull, or on the trolling motor, to send and receive underwater high-frequency sound waves.  A cable connects the transducer to the fishfinder.  The unit’s specialized software figures out the distance to detected objects, and a graphic display uses shades of gray, symbols, or bright colors to represent structures, the bottom, different temperature layers, schools of fish, and even individuals.  

Fishfinders present their results on liquid crystal display (LCD) screen. LCD displays are measured in pixels - the little square blocks on the screen that make up the image. More pixels provide better resolution and a clearer picture.  There are three main types of fishfinder displays: Passive Matrix monochrome and color LCDs, Active Matrix TFT (thin film transistor) color LCDs, and color CRTs.  Each type has advantages and disadvantages; be certain to try them all before selecting.

Good fishfinders locate thermoclines, layers or abrupt changes in water temperature, and can help you catch fish. The contact between radically different temperatures causes some of the sonar signal to reflect back, creating a line across the LCD screen that indicates the thermocline, and potentially, fish.

Newer fish finders offer split and full screen zoom, real time imaging, adjustable backgrounds, and a choice of color palettes to highlight bottom structure or a particular fish species.  An optional fuel kit enables you to track and display fuel data on screen.

585,2,3,en-US,Electronics,Electronic,electronics,"One of the great mysteries of boating is wondering what lurks beneath the waves—more specifically, how deep is the water, where are the submerged rocks, and where are the fish?

Fundamentals
A fishfinder is an electronic device, consisting of a display and a transducer that uses sound waves (SOund Navigation And Ranging, or sonar) to “see” things in the water under your boat. 

The sonar unit sends high-frequency sound waves through the water and waits for them to bounce off of underwater objects and return. By processing the outgoing and incoming sound waves, a fishfinder can determine, among other things, water depth, submerged structure, and where those sneaky fish are hiding.


Displays
The fishfinder’s display screen shows you what the sonar's seeing under your boat. The display’s graphics can be monochromatic (shades of gray) or color, depending on the unit.
 
 

Some fishfinder display screens work well in direct sunlight, whereas other displays tend to fade/wash out in the sunshine. This is important, because if you can’t make out what’s on the screen on a sunny day, the fishfinder might as well be an electric paperweight.

Display resolution, measured in pixels, determines the clarity of the image appearing on the display screen. More pixels means a sharper representation of what’s in the water below your boat.

Transducers
The transducer is responsible for transmitting and receiving the sonar’s sound waves. These sound waves radiate from the transducer in a cone-shaped formation called a beam. Beam width refers to the angle of the sound waves as they’re sent through the water.

A transducer with a wide beam width shows a larger area of the bottom in shallow water; a narrow beam width works well in deeper water.



One of the keys to good transducer performance is to mount the transducer in an area free of turbulent/bubbly water—off to one side of the transom, if possible. The transducer should be installed so it is perpendicular to the lake bottom, for maximum sound wave efficiency.


Bells & Whistles
Temperature sensors tell you what the surface water temperature is—information that may not be relevant to water temps in deeper water.

A paddlewheel transducer provides fairly accurate boat speed, a very important piece of data when you’re trolling. In addition, a paddlewheel transducer can tell you how far the boat’ traveled in a given time frame.

Bottom hardness is displayed as a horizontal line across the screen. With experience, you’ll be able to determine if the bottom is solid or muddy.

Fish icons identify potential fishy targets as sweet little fish shapes on the display screen. These video game-like characters get annoying real quick—we prefer our quarry displayed as fish arches—a much more accurate way to differentiate between weeds that might look like fish, and real fish.
 

Alarms that sound off when you’re in shallow water can prevent you from running aground (hitting bottom)—easy to do when you’re concentrating on catching fish. Be aware that since the transducer is at the back of your boat, the front of the boat is already in shallow water by the time the depth alarm sounds—so pay attention.

Caveat
Keep in mind that although an electronic fishfinder can show you where the fish are, it’s up to you to catch ‘em.

Sport boaters generally come in contact with two different types of compasses.  Your position and your heading are two key navigational factors that you need to know while on the water.  A steering compass can tell you where you are going and the handheld bearing compass can tell you where you are.  Steering compasses contain a free-spinning compass card, that points to magnetic north.  A handheld bearing compass enables you to take bearings of distant objects, which you can use to locate yourself on a chart. The hand bearing compass does not rely on electrical power or satellite reception, making it a good backup.

600,2,3,en-US,Navigation/Communication Equipment,Navigation/Communication Equipment,navigation,"<p>Finding your way on the water doesn&rsquo;t have to be intimidating, thanks to developments in electronic navigation technology. GPS: Theory of Operation A Global Positioning System (GPS) unit receives signals from 24 US Government satellites orbiting at 11,000 miles above the earth. A GPS measures how long it takes these signals to travel from the satellite to the GPS unit, and then multiplies this figure by the speed of light. This simple equation allows the GPS to determine the precise distance between the satellite sending the signal and the GPS receiver. When your GPS locks on to transmissions from at least three individual satellites, it can calculate your position in two dimensions&mdash;latitude and longitude&mdash;usually within about 10 yards or less. Locking on to a fourth satellite signal enables a GPS to determine your location in three dimensions: latitude, longitude, and altitude. The remarkable thing about the Global Positioning System is that the satellite navigational information is available to anyone, anywhere, free of charge. Of course, you&rsquo;ve got to buy a GPS receiver to use the data, but it&rsquo;s not a tremendous investment, considering the GPS&rsquo;s capabilities. Which One? A handheld GPS is ideal for small boats, providing accuracy in a compact unit. Battery operated, a handheld GPS requires no permanent mounts thus not using valuable console space in the boat. Mountable (or portable) GPS receivers have larger display screens, bigger push buttons, and more features than you&rsquo;ll find on handheld units. Most GPS&rsquo;s in this category operate on batteries and/or on external 12 volt power. Portable GPS units come with mounting brackets to hold the GPS in place while underway. When your cruise is over, you can remove the GPS for safekeeping. Fixed-mount GPS receivers offer the largest displays and most features; fixed mount GPS units are meant to be permanently installed on your boat. A stand-alone GPS is often referred to as a chartplotter. Many fixed-mount GPS&rsquo;s combine satellite navigation with fish finding functions into one compact electronic module. Maps The majority of GPS units have a basic map pre-installed in them, with the capability of adding more maps later as necessary. To expand your GPS&rsquo;s mapping knowledge base, you can, for a nominal fee, download maps from CD-ROMs&mdash;or acquire data cards containing very detailed regional maps for specific areas. Moving Forward The fact that we can find our way using satellites is astounding, but the idea of integrating a GPS unit with other on-board electronics seems a bit futuristic&mdash;like something out of a science-fiction movie. We&rsquo;re pleased to report that the future has arrived, and merging your boat&rsquo;s electronic devices with a GPS is easier than you might imagine. The technology is now available to network a GPS with radar, sonar, VHF marine radio, and a boat&rsquo;s autopilot system&mdash;just to mention a few of the more &ldquo;common&rdquo; networking applications on the market. The Global Positioning System offers seemingly endless possibilities for the high-tech boater&mdash;limited only by how fast the electronics manufacturers can develop new products&mdash;and by how much of an investment you&rsquo;re willing to make in your boat. Reminder GPS is a wonderful invention. However, like any other piece of equipment, a GPS unit isn&rsquo;t infallible&mdash;so don&rsquo;t neglect learning how to navigate with a compass and a chart&mdash;just in case.</p>","Advances in navigation and communications equipment have opened a broad range of devices and systems that can enhance your on-the-water experience.

Familiarity
Boat engines are so much more reliable than in the past—with regular maintenance they should last for decades. Just because you’ve never had a problem with your boat’s engine is no excuse for complacency.

You owe it to yourself to become familiar with your boat’s propulsion system (outboard, stern drive engine/stern drive unit, inboard engine/inboard transmission) not only for the sake of gaining knowledge or conducting routine service, but so you can perform emergency on-water repairs if necessary.

Learning
We realize that the prospect of working on your boat may be a bit intimidating—we’ve been in your shoes and we understand.

That’s why we recommend that you invest in a service manual for your boat’s engine, as well as some of the excellent do-it-yourself materials (books, CDs, DVDs, on-line) available at your local marine dealer, library, or on the internet.

Spares
Carrying spare parts on your boat (and knowing how to install them) can prevent an afternoon’s cruise from turning into an all-night misadventure. Exactly which spare parts really depends on what kind of engine your boat has, and where you’re planning to go boating. 

For example, a two-cylinder outboard motor won’t need as many spares as a V-8 inboard; the little outboard is a simple engine and has fewer components to fail than the larger engine does. 

And if you boat on a lake so small you could throw a baseball to someone on shore, your situation probably won’t require the same spare parts as the saltwater angler who ventures miles offshore. On the pond, help can be easier to get than on the high seas.
 
Without knowing your situation, we can’t give you an itemized list of what spare parts you may need—however, these are some of the most common replacement parts:

•	Belts—for the alternator, water pump, etc
•	Hoses and hose clamps
•	Spark plugs
•	Fuel filter(s)
•	Oil—two-stroke oil or four-stroke motor oil, depending on your engine
•	Fuel line
•	Transmission fluid—inboard boats
•	Coolant
•	Light bulbs (for each different light on your boat)


Make sure to write down your engine’s serial number before you go shopping for parts. On outboards, the serial number is usually on the clamp bracket (the part that holds the outboard on the boat); on inboards and stern drive boats, you can probably find the serial number on a decal located on top of the engine.

Tools
To ensure that you always have tools on board, we recommend putting together a tool kit that stays on the boat. Your boating tool kit should contain at least:

•	Vise-Grip® pliers
•	Adjustable wrench
•	Utility knife
•	Spark plug wrench
•	Propeller wrench (or a ratchet and socket that’ll fit the propeller nut)
•	Flashlight w/good batteries
•	Fuses (assorted)
•	Short length (a foot or two) of 14 gage/medium-sized insulated wire
•	Electrician’s tape 
•	Duct tape
•	Tie straps

Remember…
…that if your boat breaks down, you can’t walk home—so be prepared.

Whether you’re an old salt or a novice, we’ve got some things that might tip the scales in your favor when you’re pursing piscatorial prey.

Rod Storage
If you’re serious about fishing, chances are that you bring a half-dozen (or more) rods and reels along every time you go on a fishing trip. This alone isn’t a problem; where things get difficult is when each angler shows up at the boat with a bunch of gear—how do you stow all this stuff, yet keep it readily accessible?

We suggest outfitting your boat with as many rod holders as you can, to make the best use of the space available. First, let’s look at rod racks for the sides of the boat. Rod racks can hold as many as six rods horizontally; put a set of racks on each side of the hull to keep up to twelve rods out of the way, yet ready to go at a moment’s notice.

Tube-style rod racks can be mounted on the side(s) of your boat’s console. This style of rod holder stows your fishing rods vertically, without taking up a lot of room. 


Flush-mount rod holders only need a few inches of gunwale (or gunnel, the top edge of a boat’s sides that forms a ledge above the deck) area to create another place for your fishing poles. Most flush-mount rod holders angle the rods out and away from the boat to prevent lines from tangling while you’re trolling for big ones.



Lots of boats have rod lockers under the floor, which is a good idea, but without rod organizers, you’ll have an awful mess when you try to dig out the gear on the bottom of the pile. Rod organizers should mandatory, in our opinion.


Tackle Stash
What can you do with all those lures, those secret weapons in every angler’s arsenal? A portable tackle box is fine if you’re fishing alone, but things are gonna get crowded real quick when multiple anglers are on the same boat.

Tackle organizers are an awesome alternative to portable tackle boxes. Tackle organizers are shallow plastic trays with small compartments of various sizes that hold your lures and miscellaneous fishing gear securely in otherwise underutilized boat space. 

 
On bass boats, you’re liable to find tackle organizers in compartments on the casting deck(s). Center console boats frequently have built-in tackle organizers on the side(s) of the console.


Live Bait Solutions
By nature, baitfish are usually small and their metabolisms delicate--keeping live bait lively can be as challenging as fighting a trophy fish. The key to reducing baitfish mortality is to provide them with clean, aerated water.

Larger boats often feature built-in baitwells—dedicated tanks, complete with the pumps and plumbing necessary for baitfish comfort. Baitwells keep the water in them moving with a recirculating pump, and/or provide oxygen to the baitfish with an aeration pump—many baitwells do both.

If your boat doesn’t have a baitwell, you can still give your baitfish the comfort they expect with a portable bait tank. Bait tanks range from a bucket with an aerator pump, to rigs with recirculating/aerating capabilities rivaling those found in permanent baitwells.

Focal Point
A place for everything, and everything in its place—a credo for every fishin’ mission.

Smart Space Boats, like backpacks and RVs, have a finite amount of space for your gear (nautical term for stuff). Here are a few ideas to help you make the most of your boat&rsquo;s storage potential: &bull; Boats and boating are inherently wet activities&mdash;so what do you do with those soggy bathing suits, towels, snorkels, and fins? Stringing a clothesline is a hassle; we prefer stowing waterlogged miscellany in a mesh bag to air out &lsquo;til next time. Mesh Bag &bull; Jackets and sweatshirts keep the chill away, but when it warms up, you&rsquo;ll need a place to put the outerwear. Hanging a gear hammock (or two) is an excellent way to keep extraneous gear somewhat organized and out of the way. Gear Hammock Lugging armloads of necessities to and from your boat is less of a chore with this basket that pops open when you need it and folds flat when you don&rsquo;t. Sheet Solutions Most of the berths (beds on a boat) are a lot different (peculiar dimensions, trapezoid and V-shaped, etc) than those back home. Not to worry&mdash;sheets, blankets, and even pillows are available for nearly every variety of boat bed. Galley Notes Use disposable/recyclable paper plates and plastic cups for casual dining, especially when your crew consists of more kids than grown-ups. Don&rsquo;t forget to include lots of trash bags (we like plastic grocery sacks) to keep things ship-shape and tidy. Make sure to dispose of refuse and recycling properly when you get back to shore. Boats tend to be unstable dining platforms. With that in mind, several companies offer attractive, nearly indestructible place settings, complete with non-skid vinyl feet, designed specifically for the nautical adventurer. Dinnerware Instead of using mismatched pots and pans from the house, why not pick up a set of &ldquo;nesting&rdquo; cookware to keep on the boat? Your cooking tools will take up less room in the galley, freeing up a bit of space for other essentials.

659,2,3,en-US,Hardware and Fasteners,Hardware and Fastener,"","<p>All of the shiny (and not-so-shiny) stuff that&rsquo;s bolted to your boat is called hardware. Nuts &amp; Bolts Fasteners are the screws, nuts and bolts that attach the various pieces of hardware to your boat. Due to their corrosion resistance, stainless steel fasteners are recommended over the bright-finish screws, bolts, and nuts from your local home-improvement store. The term &ldquo;through-bolted&rdquo; means that an item of deck hardware is held in place with a bolt (or long machine screw) that goes all the way through the deck. Under the deck, a washer and nut are threaded on the bolt, and tightened with a wrench to hold the piece of deck hardware firmly in place. Rub Rail One of the most cost-effective ways to freshen up an older boat&rsquo;s appearance is to replace the rub rail&mdash;the narrow &ldquo;bumper&rdquo; that goes all the way around your boat, usually at the place where the hull meets the deck. Taking the old rub rail off isn&rsquo;t difficult; it&rsquo;s usually just a matter of removing dozens of screws that hold the rub rail on the boat. A couple of suggestions here&mdash;a cordless drill with a screwdriver bit works great for screw removal, and&mdash;those screws have been in place for a long time, so be careful not to break them off or damage the screw heads when you&rsquo;re backing them out. Installing the new rub rail is really a two-person job&mdash;again, not particularly hard, but having a second set of hands to help hold the rub rail in place is invaluable. To gain insights to the secrets of rub rail installation, one of the instructional books/CDs/DVDs that are on the market can walk you through the process step-by-step. Cleats Cleats provide a place to attach dock lines and fenders. It&rsquo;s rare to have a cleat actually fail; more often than not, the fasteners holding the cleat to the deck work loose&mdash;or come out altogether. If the cleats on your boat wiggle at all, you need to break out your tool kit and try to re-tighten the cleat&rsquo;s fasteners. Remember to use a wrench or ratchet and socket to tighten the nuts under the deck if the cleats are through-bolted. In assessing the loose-cleat scenario, if the cleats are starting to pit, rust, or otherwise be showing their age, you may want to think about swapping those old cleats out for new ones. Cleat replacement is a bit more time-consuming than it sounds, and you&rsquo;ll need another person to help with those hard-to-reach fasteners under the deck&mdash;so plan accordingly. Walk-thru Windshields Another hardware situation that&rsquo;s within the realm of the do-it-yourself boat owner is fixing a droopy walk-thru windshield. If the center glass panel doesn&rsquo;t want to close properly, chances are that the windshield fasteners and supports aren&rsquo;t as tight as they should be. You might be able to correct this situation by re-tightening the fasteners and re-adjusting the windshield supports (located on either side of the walk-thru section). It&rsquo;s possible that the windshield supports aren&rsquo;t adjustable&mdash;in that case, replace the supports with new windshield adjusters to help hold the windshield in place.

Most of us don’t sit perfectly still on board a boat, even if it’s raining. Physical activity generates body heat and water vapor (in the form of perspiration). This isn’t an issue when it’s nice out—the sweat evaporates into the atmosphere. 

Wrap a sheet of plastic around your sweaty self in a rainstorm and soon you’re gonna be really miserable—hot and sticky if it’s warm out, or chilled to the bone if the weather’s the least bit cold.

PVC rainsuits are just that—pieces of plastic fashioned into outerwear that’ll keep you dry enough, but usually aren’t the best for all-day use. Inexpensive and easy to clean, PVC foul weather gear is great to keep on board “just in case” it rains.

 
 

Breathable Fabrics
So, how do we address the situation of staying dry, both inside and outside the rain gear? That’s where breathable fabrics come in to the picture.

Breathable fabrics take a couple of different approaches to protecting you from the elements while permitting perspiration a way to escape from inside the garment.

One of, if not the most, efficient types of foul weather gear is made of a material with microscopic holes in it (called microporous fabric). Multiple layers of this microporous fabric are laminated together; the outside is coated with a water-resistant substance (often silicone) to keep the liquid water (rain) out. The inner fabric’s microscopic pores allow water vapor (perspiration) to pass through to the outer layer, thus keeping you more comfortable.

The other “breathable” foul weather gear uses a hydrophilic (having an affinity for water) substance on the side exposed to the rain. This coating doesn’t have any tiny pores to vent inner water vapor out. Instead, moisture from the inside of the garment moves through the molecular structure of the outer coating, and on to wherever it is that sweat goes. Not quite as good of a method as microporous fabrics, but still better than PVC plastic.

 
  

Foul weather gear picks up where the sunshine leaves off, so make sure you equip yourself for your style of boating. 

“Expect the best, but prepare for the worst.”
","Like any other recreational activity, boating has its own wardrobe requirements, but not to worry—any day on the water is considered “casual”.

For other signaling chores, a single sideband (SSB) radio can function as a shortwave receiver, but they tend to draw a lot of current that can deplete battery banks quickly.  Very high frequency (VHF) marine radios are the core communication device on boats and will communicate clearly up to 60 miles. 

Also, ensure that your boat’s lights are in good working order on every cruise because the lights can be used for signaling.  Your ship’s horn, whether it is hand-held and portable or a fixed electric mount, is excellent for signaling.

Marine hatches generally close to cover an opening in the deck.  Consequently, the hatches must be designed to drain quickly, seal tightly, and have a quick locking and unlocking mechanism.  You want hatches that are strong, fit precisely, and have a smooth, dependable locking mechanism with a built-in, never-lost handle.  Hatches may be transparent or translucent to let light into the interior of the boat.

A dedicated weather radio, tuned to the National Weather Service (NWS) or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather station, can be a life saver.  Look for a unit, either portable or fixed mount, that monitors all NOAA and NWS channels and weather warnings.  Most weather radios display current temperature, clock, and calendar functions, and can also come with a freeze alarm with audio and visual alerts, three levels of messages, a non volatile memory back-up, dual alarm with snooze function, and a choice of power options.
The NAVTEX system automatically broadcasts localized Maritime Safety Information (MSI) using Radio Telex, also known as narrow band direct printing, or NBDP.  The system mainly operates in the medium frequency radio band, and has a range of about 300 nautical miles from the transmitter.  NAVTEX covers the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea, coastal areas around Japan, and areas around the North American continent.  A NAVTEX receiver has an integrated printer, display, and keyboard in a compact unit.

728,2,3,en-US,"Sail Hardware, Rigging","Sail Hardware, Rigging","","Due to the nature of using the wind for power, a sailboat’s hardware endures a lot more stress and strain than a powerboat of comparable size. Over the years, all this hard work takes its toll and things start to wear out or fail—not a good thing.

Fasteners
Starting with one of the fundamental topics, let’s take a close look at what actually holds all those pieces of hardware in place—fasteners—or more precisely, the bolts, nuts, and screws that keep everything together.

On a boat, the fasteners should be made of a marine-grade stainless steel. Stainless steel fasteners don’t rust or corrode like the nuts and bolts you might use around the house. 

When you attach hardware to the deck, you should thru-bolt the item. Thru-bolting means drilling a hole in the mounting surface, and using a long bolt that goes all the way through the piece of hardware, through the mounting surface, with sufficient bolt threads exposed on the underside so you can put a washer and nut on.

Thru-bolting can be kind of a pain, but don’t take the easy way out and use sheetmetal screws to fasten anything of importance to your boat. The screws will pull out under the slightest strain. 

 
Railings
One of the most common areas of sailboat hardware concern deals with the boat’s rails and the rail fittings that secure the rails to the boat. Over the course of several years, the rail fittings have a tendency to work loose, becoming wobbly when you lean on them.


This situation can often be resolved by re-tightening the fasteners at the base of each rail fitting. Take care not to mar the bolt heads during this process—damaged bolts can be a major chore to remove.

If re-tightening the rail fittings doesn’t do the job, you’ll have to replace the old fasteners with new ones (re-fastening, in nautical-speak). Here’s a tip: put some marine sealant on each bolt shank before you push it through the deck. The sealant can help to keep water from seeping in. Adding a drop of thread sealer to the bolt prior to starting the nut will ensure that the nut doesn’t come off until you want it to.

Lines
You should also be aware that the lines that make up your sailboat’s running rigging aren’t infallible—lines deteriorate with age, making them weak and prone to failure at the most inopportune time.

If your lines are suspect, now’s a good opportunity to consider an upgrade to new ones.

Two of the most common types of line are: three-strand and braided. Due to the fact that nylon three-strand line stretches quite a bit, most sailors use it for anchor or dock lines.

Braided lines, as the name implies, consist of multiple fibers braided together. Single braid lines don’t have an outside covering, making them very flexible. Double braid lines feature a braided cover over a braided core, making them the line of choice for running rigging.

Replacing your lines isn’t really an expense; it’s more of an investment in future boating pleasure.

Looking Ahead
Maintaining your sailboat’s hardware requires a little extra time, and more often than not, a bit more effort in order to do things right—but it’ll be worth it in the long run.

Varnish consists of oil, solvents, thinners, resins, UV inhibitors, dryers and additives in varying amounts.  Varnish can have a gloss or matte appearance, be extremely hard for walked-on surfaces, and can vary in color.  Newer oil-based varnishes have improved durability in the worst environments.

Whether you’re refurbishing an older boat or simply want to make better use of the space available on your vessel, updating the seating arrangements can go a long way towards a new look and better functionality.

Lounge Seats
Back-to-back lounge seats have been around for as long as we can remember. Lounge seats consist of two seats—one facing forward and one facing aft—sitting atop a rectangular box (base). A reclining mechanism connects the two seats to each other and to the base.

Lounge seats stay upright during boat rides, and become a place to catch some rays when the boat’s stationary. To recline the seats, lift up the bottom cushions and pull the away from the seat base. The seat backs will drop into place on top of the seat base, making a marginally comfortable sun lounge.

As an added bonus, you can hide stuff in the seat base—a real benefit on smaller boats.

Swingback Seats
The swingback cooler seat is a marvelous innovation. Essentially, a swingback seat is a large ice chest with a padded lid and a built-in backrest that’s hinged at the bottom, allowing you to sit on top of the cooler facing forward when underway, then you can swing the backrest the other way to face aft for fishing.

The seat’s base—the cooler—is easy to remove and to put back in place.

Adding a swingback seat to your center console boat or pontoon boat is an excellent use of limited floor space.

We’d put one of these seats in our boat any day.

Pedestal Seats
Let’s say there’s a place on your boat where sometimes you need a seat, and other times you don’t—so a permanently mounted seat’s out of the question—what can you do? We think pedestal seats might be the answer.

A pedestal seat is made up of three parts:
•	The base—located on the boat’s deck, often is a circular plate with a hole in the center
•	The pedestal—a cylindrical tube that rests securely in the center hole of the base
•	The seat—a single seat that fits on top of the pedestal

 
Many boats have several pedestal bases on the deck, but just a few pedestal seats to go in them. For example, a fishing boat may have six bases—and only two pedestal seats in the boat, leaving plenty of deck space for fighting fish. If you want to bring more fishing partners, just add more pedestal seats.
 
 

Tables
After being on the water a while, we tend to get hungry and thirsty. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a place to eat—a table, maybe? Not a problem.

One of the benefits of using pedestal seats is that the same base that holds your fishing chair can often be used to secure a removable table. Just like a pedestal seat, you can put the table up for fine dining, and stow it out of the way to conserve deck area.


The removable table concept is very popular on deck boats and pontoon boats, where entertaining might be a higher priority than fishing. We personally like having a table on board—it gives us a place to rest our elbows during meals.

A Tale of Two Trailers
A boat trailer’s job is to support the boat’s hull, while providing a stable, secure transportation platform for your boat. 

There are two types of boat trailers: bunk trailers and roller trailers.

Most bunk trailers use long boards covered with carpet (bunks) to support a boat. These trailers are sometimes called “drive on” trailers, because you can literally use the boat’s engine to push the boat onto the trailer at the boat ramp.


Roller trailers have several sets of rubber/plastic rollers, mounted on pivoting bases, to carry the weight of the boat. Roller trailers are great for launching and retrieving a boat from a steep boat ramp—the rollers allow the boat to move on and off the trailer with less effort than with a bunk style trailer—so you can crank the boat on the trailer with the winch, instead of powering the boat onto the trailer with the engine.


After several seasons, you’ll probably need to put new carpet on the bunks (bunk trailer), or replace some of the rollers (roller trailer).



Bearings & Lubrication
The tires on your boat trailer are mounted on rims. The rims bolt to spindles, and the spindles attach to the axle. Inside of the spindles are bearings that reduce the friction between the spindles and axle.

The bearings require lubrication to prevent them from overheating (and failing) from excess friction. Most trailer bearings use waterproof grease as a lubricant; high-end trailers may use a thick oil to keep the bearings lubricated.

Either way, it’s very important to make sure the bearings have plenty of lubricant in them every time you take your boat to the launch ramp.

Grease lubricated bearings often have a small fitting in the center of the spindle. Using a grease gun on the fitting, pump fresh grease in the bearings until they’re full.

Oil lubricated bearings have a sight glass on the end of the spindle (rather than a grease fitting), allowing you to check the oil visually—without all the mess of a grease gun.

Trailer Lights
We don’t know any boaters who haven’t had problems with their trailer lights at some time or another.
 
A boat trailer’s light system isn’t complicated: a couple of lights on the rear, maybe some marker lights on the sides—all connected together with wires that run from the front of the trailer to the back.

So why all the trailer light hassles? 

When you back the trailer into the water, you use the brakes on the tow vehicle. Putting your foot on the brake pedal makes both the vehicle’s and the trailer’s brake lights come on. The light bulbs in the brake lights/tail lights get hot when they’re on—and often fail when the hot bulbs are immersed in the cold water.

To avoid this, make it a habit to unplug the trailer lights at the boat ramp. Just don’t forget to connect the lights to the tow vehicle before you hit the road.


The Easy Way Out
Troubleshooting trailer light issues can be an exercise in frustration. If your boat trailer is more than ten years old (+/-), we wouldn’t invest a lot of time working on the lights—we’d suggest installing a new light system, complete with lights and wiring. 

A new light system isn’t expensive, and a lot less aggravating than trying to resurrect old, dying trailer lights.


","Although your boat will spend about 95% of its life on a trailer, the trailer is one of the most neglected aspects of the boating equation—not a good thing.  A boat trailer’s job is to support the boat’s hull, while providing a stable, secure transportation platform for your boat.  There are two types of boat trailers: bunk trailers and roller trailers.

In Retrospect
In days gone by, when we talked about watersports, we were really talking about water skiing. Zipping about on skis established a reference point for watery adventure. Truly hardy souls could push the envelope by ski-jumping a ramp—or by not using skis at all—barefootin’ seemed to be the very edge of watersports world.

My, how things have changed. 

Sure, you can still go water skiing, but for more thrills, you might want to check out the nearly unlimited selection of water toys that are available. Many of these towable toys don’t require much athletic ability—just hang on tight—while others will test your physical fitness to the max.

Tubes & Inflatable Toys
The concept of tying a rope to an inflated truck inner tube and dragging it around behind your boat has evolved into a highly specialized form of recreation. Tubes and related toys come in all shapes, sizes, and colors—and range from the mild kiddy ride to the adrenalin rush of a waterborne roller coaster.
 

 

And if you don’t like riding alone, some of these toys can seat up to five people (more or less, depending on the size of the people).

Boarding
There’s nothing quite like the sensation of flight—especially if you’re on a wakeboard flying behind a boat. Or a wake skate…or a kneeboard. The acrobatic potential is amazing, limited only by one’s imagination (or sense of self-preservation).

Definitely not for the meek and faint of heart, one-board watersports have emerged as showcases for those with a flair for demonstrative fun.

Easy Does It
For those who prefer a low-key approach to a day on the lake, we suggest taking a close look at the various floats, recliners, and water lounges on the market. Lazing about has undergone its own evolution to the point that one doesn’t even need to go back to the boat to retrieve refreshments—simply reach over to your floating cooler for another beverage—and wonder how the other half lives.


Accessorization
No activity is complete without an entire selection of accessories, and watersports is no exception. 

Inflatable toys need to be inflated, so a miniature air compressor is a must. To tow the toys, you’ll require a stout tow rope of sufficient length. And to attach the rope to the boat to tow the toys, you’ll need a ski pylon, tow ring—or for hardcore extreme watersports enthusiast, a wake board tower—including high-output speakers, and a tower-mounted video camera to capture those mega-moments for posterity.
 

In addition, your boat should be outfitted with a means to transport fully inflated toys to and from your favorite cove.



Be Safe
Don’t forget the safety gear. Personal flotation devices (PFD) are absolutely necessary—not an option. Watersports-specific PFDs have been developed to address the needs of skiers, boarders, tubers—so invest in the best PFD you can find—and wear it. We want you to be around for a long time.

The substance seals leaky seams and rivets in aluminum hulls, leaks around fiberglass cabins or decks, and fills minor cracks and pinholes. Sealants act as a barrier coat to minimize water absorption and galvanic corrosion.  Caulking is the process, and material, used to seal the seams in wooden boats and riveted iron or steel ships, in order to make them watertight.  Look for a product that is long lasting, permanently flexible, which can be sanded, painted, and used above and below the waterline.  Marine polysulfide sealants are very popular for bonding to fiberglass, wood, metal, glass, and itself. It can be applied underwater for emergency repairs and is ideal for teak decks, to bed deck and hull hardware, seal thru-hull fittings, and underwater seams.

Begin with a bottom cleaner to remove all stains and grime from the hull and surfaces.  A fabric guard restores lasting water repellency to marine canvas, stops leaks, protects against soiling and both water and oil based stains, and resists mildew formation and UV sun damage.  A dehumidification product dries air to a level where mildew cannot grow and stops odors.  You will also need to winterize and flush your boat’s engine and fuel system.

647,3,3,en-US,Trim System/Trim Tabs,Trim System/Trim Tab,"","","Power tilt and trim systems enable you to adjust the angle of your outboard motor.  You can tuck your motor in to get your boat on plane smoother and faster.  When underway, you can change the angle of your motor to get the best performance for your load and water conditions. Power tilt and trim gives you a more stable ride, increases top end speed, more prop clearance and better fuel efficiency.

Trim tabs get your boat on a plane quickly by increasing the lift generated by the engine. They also allow you to go more slowly while still remaining on a plane, so fuel consumption is decreased.  For smaller outboards injection-molded polypropylene fins install easily on the cavitation plate.  The system optimizes your boat’s trim, its fore and aft and side-to-side attitude in the water, for changing weather and sea conditions and to improve its ride and handling.  Automatic tabs work better on smaller boats or for the budget conscious boater.  Hydraulic tabs have more control over the boat’s trim and provide adjustable lift for r varying weight distribution and changing sea conditions.
