 * @{
 * Implement a content entity.
 *
 * This module demonstrates implementing a nmmacontentaccess node.
 *
 * Entity API is the API that stores pieces of content and configuration for
 * Drupal core. For instance, if you've encountered node content types, you've
 * encountered entities of type 'node.'
 *
 * This example implements the Entity API so that we have an entity type usable
 * by the user which you might think of as specialized nodes, but which are
 * different from nodes. These entities are called NmmaNode, and are known
 * internally by the machine name nmmacontentaccess_node.
 *
 * NmmaNode is a fieldable content entity used to hold structured information
 * without the overhead of using a node content type. 'Fieldable' means you can
 * attach fields to it, like you can with nodes. It is defined programmatically
 * (completely in code). We will show the main techniques to handle and expose
 * the contents of this entity type.
 *
 * The NmmaNode entity will demonstrate the main tasks for an entity:
 * - define
 * - save
 * - load
 * - view
 * - edit
 * - delete
 * - control access
 *
 * Where ever possible, we use the amazing tools built into D8 natively.
